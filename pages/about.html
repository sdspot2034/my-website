			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>An astute learner with a flair for programming, an articulate person whose expressions (whether written or spoken) are always clear and concise, and unflichingly dedicated - I am a student of B. Tech (CSE) pursuing the 3rd year of graduation from Amity University. My core specialities include scripting in Python, Machine Learning and Data Science, however I have dabbled in a bit of Android App Development (with Java), and Web Development (HTML, CSS, and JS). </p>
      		<p>I am a fun-loving, outgoing person, who loves to get to know new people. Always a voracious reader, my love for speaking and writing were only to be expected! I am both a dweeb and a weeb, so I can often be found snuggled up in bed binging series, munching on chips, and getting fat - it's my natural habitat (:-P). I hope some day I can realise my dream and effectuate my wanderlust.</p>
